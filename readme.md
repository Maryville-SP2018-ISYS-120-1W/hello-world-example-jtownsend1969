# Week 1 Lecture Development Example: Hello World!
 
### Lecture Development Examples Overview

The purpose of lecture development examples is for you, the instructor, to have a finished application that is appropriate for you to build in class. This repository is the finished product. The expectation is that you would construct this, from scratch, with the students.

It is recommended you show them the finished product first that. This establishes the goal of what you will build. Additionally, the context of the application should also be established (e.g., this is for someone who trades bitcoins).

### App Context

In the first lecture of a first course in computer programming, it is ubiquitous to have students construct some program that prints or displays the string "Hello World!". This repository contains such a finished program.

### Learning Points

This should be the first time student's are using the XCode to build an iOS App. Be sure to go slow through the start up process of creating a new app. When starting from scratch, you should create a "Single View App" which will give you a single storyboard on which to add the label for "Hello World" and the button for "Update".

I suggest worrying less about the code, but talking more generally about the operations you are doing in XCode and what purpose they serve. For example:

* What is a single view application?
* What is the storyboard? Why is it separate from the ViewController?
* How do we view all the UIKit controls available to us?
* We use the side-by-side view of the storyboard and the ViewController to create connections between them such as Outlets and Actions.
